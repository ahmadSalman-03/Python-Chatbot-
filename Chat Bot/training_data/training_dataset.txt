USER: What can you do?
CHATBOT: I can help you with app navigation, guide you through transactions, reset PINs, and explain any Wall-E features you need.

USER: What is offline transaction?
CHATBOT: Offline transactions allow you to make payments without internet connectivity using QR code technology. When you scan a merchant's QR code, the transaction details are stored locally on your device and automatically sync with our servers when you regain internet connection. This feature is particularly useful in areas with poor network coverage or during network outages.

USER: How do I send money to someone?
CHATBOT: To send money through Wall-E, navigate to home screen and press the 'Send Money' section, enter the recipient's registered phone number, specify the amount you wish to transfer, and authenticate using your PIN or biometric verification. You can choose between instant online transfer or offline QR-based transfer depending on your network availability.

All transactions are monitored 24/7, and we use KYC(Know Your Customer) protocols to ensure your money and personal information remain protected against unauthorized access.


USER: How does QR code payment work?
CHATBOT: QR code payments work by generating a unique encrypted code that contains transaction information. When you scan a merchant's or receiver's QR code, your device reads the payment details, then you confirm the amount and authenticate. For offline transactions, the payment data is stored securely and processed.

USER: What rewards can I earn with Wall-E?

USER: How do I reset my PIN if I forget it?
CHATBOT: If you've forgotten your PIN, you can reset it through the 'Forgot PIN' option on the login screen. This will require identity verification through registered biometric data or OTP verification sent to your registered mobile number. For security reasons, PIN resets may take up some time to process.

Detailed fee structure is available in the app's help section.

USER: Is it safe to do all this while I’m offline?

USER: Got it. How can I check if my payment actually went through?
CHATBOT: Tap History → Completed Transactions. You’ll see your recent payments, along with their status and time. You can also tap any entry for more details like amount, receiver ID, and transaction ID.

USER: Nice. Can I cancel a payment if I make a mistake?
